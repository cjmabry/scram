# wagtail-wtr

Wagtail build with common organizing features, web best practices, and modern dev tools out of the box.

Built by [With the Ranks](https://withtheranks.com), used as a starting point for campaign, nonprofit, and organizer websites, and updated with new features periodically.

Fork this repo and customize via Tailwind theme to build your own site, and merge upstream changes to get new features as they're released. See [#Customization](#customization) for more information.

Supports theming via semantic Tailwind design tokens, supports multiple languages,
contains a StreamField library with common organizing blocks like Signup and Donate, has integrations with common organizing platforms like Action Network and Actblue, features custom page types ready to extend and more.

The `wtrx/` sub-app contains core shared features and is designed for eventual extraction as a standalone pip package
(`wagtail-wtrx`), inspired by [CodeRed Extensions](https://github.com/coderedcorp/coderedcms), so that sites built on top of  `wagtail-wtr` can utilize future platform updates.

## Customization

### 1. Fork the repo on GitHub

Use the **Fork** button on GitHub, or with the GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh repo fork With-the-Ranks/wagtail-wtr --clone --remote
cd wagtail-wtr   # use your fork's name here if you renamed it on GitHub
```

If you fork manually, clone your fork and add the upstream remote:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yourorg/your-site.git
cd your-site
git remote add upstream git@github.com:With-the-Ranks/wagtail-wtr.git
```

### 2. Complete initial setup

Follow the [Quickstart](#quickstart) steps above. The short version:

```bash
make venv
source .venv/bin/activate
npm install
make build
make migrate
make setup          # sets site name, donation platform, signup platform
make createsuperuser
make dev
```

### 3. Brand and configure your fork

- **Public site name**: set during `make setup` — stored in the Wagtail `Site` model
  (also editable later in Wagtail admin → Settings → Sites).
- **Admin interface label**: update `WAGTAIL_SITE_NAME` in `wagtail_wtr/settings/base.py`.
- **Brand colors and fonts**: edit `static_src/css/theme.css` (see [Customizing the theme](#customizing-the-theme)).

Everything else is covered in [What to customize](#what-to-customize) below.

### 4. Pulling upstream updates

When new blocks, bug fixes, or features land in this repo, pull them into your fork:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

Most upstream changes land in `wagtail_wtr/wtrx/`, `templates/`, and
`static_src/css/main.css` — none of which you should be editing on your fork.
The only file likely to produce a conflict is `static_src/css/theme.css` if you
have customised your brand colors. Resolve by keeping your `@theme {}` block and
accepting upstream additions (e.g. new `[data-theme]` presets) from the merge.
After merging, run `make build` to regenerate `static_compiled/` from your local `theme.css`.

### 5. Contributing changes back upstream

If you build something reusable — a new block, a base model improvement, a
bug fix — you can contribute it back to `wagtail-wtr` via a pull request.

**Rule of thumb**: only code in `wagtail_wtr/wtrx/`, `templates/`, and shared
`static_src/` belongs upstream. Brand colors, site-specific page models, and
fork-specific configuration stay on your fork.

#### Step-by-step

1. **Identify the commit(s) to contribute.** Your fork's `main` may contain
   site-specific commits mixed in with reusable work. Use `git log --oneline`
   to find the relevant commit SHA(s).

2. **Create a feature branch off upstream `main`:**

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature upstream/main
   ```

3. **Cherry-pick the reusable commit(s) onto the branch:**

   ```bash
   git cherry-pick <sha>
   ```

   If the commit bundles site-specific changes with reusable ones, split it
   using `git cherry-pick --no-commit <sha>` (applies the diff without
   committing), then `git reset HEAD` to unstage everything, then `git add -p`
   to selectively stage only the reusable hunks before committing.
   Alternatively, reconstruct the diff manually on the new branch.

4. **Push the branch to your fork (origin) and open a PR targeting upstream:**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-feature
   ```

   Then open a PR on GitHub:
   - Base repository: `With-the-Ranks/wagtail-wtr`, base branch: `main`
   - Head repository: your fork, head branch: `feature/my-feature`

   GitHub shows a **"compare across forks"** link on the upstream repo's
   Pull Requests page. The direct URL pattern is:
   ```
   https://github.com/With-the-Ranks/wagtail-wtr/compare/main...<yourorg>:feature/my-feature
   ```

5. **After the PR is merged**, rebase your fork's `main` onto upstream so the
   duplicate commit is cleanly dropped:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git rebase upstream/main
   git push origin main --force-with-lease
   ```

   If the upstream maintainer merged the PR without changes, Git detects the
   equivalent patch and skips it automatically. If the commit was amended or
   squash-merged upstream, you may see a small conflict — resolve it with
   `git rebase --skip` to drop the duplicate. After the rebase your fork's
   `main` should be ahead by only your site-specific commits and 0 commits
   behind upstream.

## What to customize

### Edit freely — this is your site

| File / directory | What to change |
|---|---|
| `static_src/css/theme.css` | Brand colors (`--color-primary-*`, etc.), fonts, theme presets |
| `wagtail_wtr/settings/base.py` | `WAGTAIL_SITE_NAME`, `WTRX_DONATION_PLATFORM`, `WTRX_SIGNUP_PLATFORM`, `LANGUAGES` |
| `wagtail_wtr/home/` | `HomePage` model and template |
| `wagtail_wtr/pages/` | Add or modify page types (`ContentPage`, `IndexPage`, new types) |
| `wagtail_wtr/forms/` | Customise form page behavior |
| `templates/` | Override or extend any template |
| `static_src/javascript/` | Add site-specific JS components |
| Wagtail admin | Settings > Branding, Navigation, Footer, Social, Integrations |

### Don't edit — pull upstream cleanly

| File / directory | Why |
|---|---|
| `wagtail_wtr/wtrx/` | Core reusable app — blocks, base models, settings models, hooks. Upstream changes land here. |
| `static_src/css/main.css` | Tailwind infrastructure — imports, plugins, base layer. Leaving it unedited ensures conflict-free upstream merges. |

### Extend, don't modify

- **Page models**: subclass `BasePage` and `HeroMixin` from `wtrx/` in your own apps (`home/`, `pages/`, etc.)
- **StreamField blocks**: use `BodyStreamBlock` as-is, or subclass it to add site-specific blocks
- **Settings models**: create new `BaseSiteSetting` subclasses (from `wagtail.contrib.settings`) in your own apps if you need additional settings panels beyond what `wtrx/` already provides.

`wtrx/` is the stable core. Site-specific code goes in `home/`, `pages/`, `forms/`,
or new apps. Extend or override `wtrx/` models and blocks; don't edit them directly.

---

## Customizing the theme

Edit the `@theme {}` block in `static_src/css/theme.css` to change the semantic design tokens:

```css
@theme {
  /* Replace these color scales with your brand palette */
  --color-primary-50:  #f0f9ff;
  --color-primary-500: #0ea5e9;
  --color-primary-600: #0284c7;
  /* ... full scale 50–950 ... */

  /* Font stacks */
  --font-heading: 'Your Heading Font', system-ui, sans-serif;
  --font-body:    'Your Body Font', system-ui, sans-serif;
}
```

All templates use only semantic tokens (`bg-primary-600`, `font-heading`, etc.), so
changing the `@theme {}` values immediately re-themes the entire site. Rebuild after changes:

```bash
make build-prod
```

`theme.css` also ships named theme presets (`[data-theme="grassroots"]`, etc.) as
CSS overrides — no rebuild needed when switching between presets at runtime. Client
forks that don't use these can delete those blocks.

---

## Adding languages

In `wagtail_wtr/settings/base.py`, uncomment or add languages:

```python
WAGTAIL_CONTENT_LANGUAGES = LANGUAGES = [
    ("en", "English"),
    ("es", "Spanish"),
]
```

Translations are managed via the Wagtail admin using wagtail-localize.

---

## Platform integrations

Set defaults in `settings/base.py`:

```python
WTRX_DONATION_PLATFORM = "none"          # none | actblue
WTRX_SIGNUP_PLATFORM = "wagtail_forms"   # wagtail_forms | action_network | none
```

Override per-site in the Wagtail admin under **Settings > Integrations**.

---

## Development

```bash
# Watch mode: rebuilds CSS on file changes
make watch

# Run tests
python manage.py test wagtail_wtr

# Run a specific test module
python manage.py test wagtail_wtr.wtrx.tests.test_images

# Generate migrations after model changes
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Create `wagtail_wtr/settings/local.py` for personal overrides (gitignored):

```python
from .dev import *

DATABASES = { ... }   # override as needed
DEBUG = True
```

---
