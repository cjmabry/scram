# wagtail-wtr

A Wagtail website used by With the Ranks for campaign, nonprofit, and organizer
websites. Fork or clone this repo to start a new site.

Includes semantic Tailwind design tokens, multi-lingual support via wagtail-localize,
AJAX form submission, a 15-block StreamField library, and 4 page types ready to extend.

The `wtrx/` sub-app is designed for eventual extraction as a standalone pip package
(`wagtail-wtrx`), following the CodeRed CMS pattern.

`wtrx/` is the stable core. Site-specific code goes in `home/`, `pages/`, `forms/`,
or new apps. Extend or override `wtrx/` models and blocks; don't edit them directly.

---

## Customizing the theme

Edit the `@theme {}` block in `static_src/css/theme.css` to change the semantic design tokens:

```css
@theme {
  /* Replace these color scales with your brand palette */
  --color-primary-50:  #f0f9ff;
  --color-primary-500: #0ea5e9;
  --color-primary-600: #0284c7;
  /* ... full scale 50–950 ... */

  /* Font stacks */
  --font-heading: 'Your Heading Font', system-ui, sans-serif;
  --font-body:    'Your Body Font', system-ui, sans-serif;
}
```

All templates use only semantic tokens (`bg-primary-600`, `font-heading`, etc.), so
changing the `@theme {}` values immediately re-themes the entire site. Rebuild after changes:

```bash
make build-prod
```

`theme.css` also ships named theme presets (`[data-theme="grassroots"]`, etc.) as
CSS overrides — no rebuild needed when switching between presets at runtime. Client
forks that don't use these can delete those blocks.

---

## Adding languages

In `wagtail_wtr/settings/base.py`, uncomment or add languages:

```python
WAGTAIL_CONTENT_LANGUAGES = LANGUAGES = [
    ("en", "English"),
    ("es", "Spanish"),
]
```

Translations are managed via the Wagtail admin using wagtail-localize.

---

## Platform integrations

Set defaults in `settings/base.py`:

```python
WTRX_DONATION_PLATFORM = "none"          # none | actblue
WTRX_SIGNUP_PLATFORM = "wagtail_forms"   # wagtail_forms | action_network | none
```

Override per-site in the Wagtail admin under **Settings > Integrations**.

---

## Development

```bash
# Watch mode: rebuilds CSS on file changes
make watch

# Run tests
python manage.py test wagtail_wtr

# Run a specific test module
python manage.py test wagtail_wtr.wtrx.tests.test_images

# Generate migrations after model changes
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Create `wagtail_wtr/settings/local.py` for personal overrides (gitignored):

```python
from .dev import *

DATABASES = { ... }   # override as needed
DEBUG = True
```

---

## Deployment

Ships with:

- `Dockerfile` (Python 3.13-slim)
- `whitenoise` for static file serving
- `gunicorn` as WSGI server
- `dj-database-url` for `DATABASE_URL` env var
