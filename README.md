# wagtail-wtr

Wagtail build with common organizing features, web best practices, and modern dev tools out of the box.

Built by [With the Ranks](https://withtheranks.com), used as a starting point for campaign, nonprofit, and organizer websites, and updated with new features periodically.

Fork this repo and customize via Tailwind theme to build your own site, and merge upstream changes to get new features as they're released. See [#Customization](#customization) for more information.

Supports theming via semantic Tailwind design tokens, supports multiple languages,
contains a StreamField library with common organizing blocks like Signup and Donate, has integrations with common organizing platforms like Action Network and Actblue, features custom page types ready to extend and more.

The `wtrx/` app (repo root, sibling to `wagtail_wtr/`) contains core shared features and is designed for eventual extraction as a standalone pip package
(`wagtail-wtrx`), inspired by [CodeRed Extensions](https://github.com/coderedcorp/coderedcms), so that sites built on top of  `wagtail-wtr` can utilize future platform updates.

## Customization

### 1. Fork the repo on GitHub

Use the **Fork** button on GitHub, or with the GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh repo fork With-the-Ranks/wagtail-wtr --clone --remote
cd wagtail-wtr   # use your fork's name here if you renamed it on GitHub
```

If you fork manually, clone your fork and add the upstream remote:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yourorg/your-site.git
cd your-site
git remote add upstream git@github.com:With-the-Ranks/wagtail-wtr.git
```

### 2. Complete initial setup

Follow the [Quickstart](#quickstart) steps above. The short version:

```bash
make venv
source .venv/bin/activate
npm install
make build
make migrate
make setup          # sets site name, donation platform, signup platform
make createsuperuser
make dev
```

### 3. Brand and configure your fork

- **Public site name**: set during `make setup` — stored in the Wagtail `Site` model
  (also editable later in Wagtail admin → Settings → Sites).
- **Admin interface label**: update `WAGTAIL_SITE_NAME` in `wagtail_wtr/settings/base.py`.
- **Brand colors and fonts**: edit `static_src/css/theme.css` (see [Customizing the theme](#customizing-the-theme)).

Everything else is covered in [What to customize](#what-to-customize) below.

### 4. Pulling upstream updates

When new blocks, bug fixes, or features land in this repo, pull them into your fork:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

Most upstream changes land in `wtrx/`, `templates/`, and
`static_src/css/main.css` — none of which you should be editing on your fork.
The only file likely to produce a conflict is `static_src/css/theme.css` if you
have customised your brand colors. Resolve by keeping your `@theme {}` block and
accepting upstream additions (e.g. new `[data-theme]` presets) from the merge.
After merging, run `make build` to regenerate `static_compiled/` from your local `theme.css`.

### 5. Contributing changes back upstream

If you build something reusable — a new block, a base model improvement, a
bug fix — you can contribute it back to `wagtail-wtr` via a pull request.

**Rule of thumb**: only code in `wagtail_wtr/wtrx/`, `templates/`, and shared
`static_src/` belongs upstream. Brand colors, site-specific page models, and
fork-specific configuration stay on your fork.

#### Step-by-step

1. **Identify the commit(s) to contribute.** Your fork's `main` may contain
   site-specific commits mixed in with reusable work. Use `git log --oneline`
   to find the relevant commit SHA(s).

2. **Create a feature branch off upstream `main`:**

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature upstream/main
   ```

3. **Cherry-pick the reusable commit(s) onto the branch:**

   ```bash
   git cherry-pick <sha>
   ```

   If the commit bundles site-specific changes with reusable ones, split it
   using `git cherry-pick --no-commit <sha>` (applies the diff without
   committing), then `git reset HEAD` to unstage everything, then `git add -p`
   to selectively stage only the reusable hunks before committing.
   Alternatively, reconstruct the diff manually on the new branch.

4. **Push the branch to your fork (origin) and open a PR targeting upstream:**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-feature
   ```

   Then open a PR on GitHub:
   - Base repository: `With-the-Ranks/wagtail-wtr`, base branch: `main`
   - Head repository: your fork, head branch: `feature/my-feature`

   GitHub shows a **"compare across forks"** link on the upstream repo's
   Pull Requests page. The direct URL pattern is:
   ```
   https://github.com/With-the-Ranks/wagtail-wtr/compare/main...<yourorg>:feature/my-feature
   ```

5. **After the PR is merged**, rebase your fork's `main` onto upstream so the
   duplicate commit is cleanly dropped:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git rebase upstream/main
   git push origin main --force-with-lease
   ```

   If the upstream maintainer merged the PR without changes, Git detects the
   equivalent patch and skips it automatically. If the commit was amended or
   squash-merged upstream, you may see a small conflict — resolve it with
   `git rebase --skip` to drop the duplicate. After the rebase your fork's
   `main` should be ahead by only your site-specific commits and 0 commits
   behind upstream.

## What to customize

### Edit freely — this is your site

| File / directory | What to change |
|---|---|
| `static_src/css/theme.css` | Brand colors (`--color-primary-*`, etc.), fonts, theme presets |
| `wagtail_wtr/settings/base.py` | `WAGTAIL_SITE_NAME`, `WTRX_DONATION_PLATFORM`, `WTRX_SIGNUP_PLATFORM`, `LANGUAGES` |
| `templates/` | Override or extend any template (shadow `templates/wtrx/<path>`) |
| `static_src/javascript/` | Add site-specific JS components |
| Wagtail admin | Settings > Branding, Navigation, Footer, Social, Integrations |

### Don't edit — pull upstream cleanly

| File / directory | Why |
|---|---|
| `wtrx/` | Core reusable app — blocks, page models, settings models, views, hooks. Upstream changes land here. |
| `static_src/css/main.css` | Tailwind infrastructure — imports, plugins, base layer. Leaving it unedited ensures conflict-free upstream merges. |

### Extend, don't modify

- **Page models**: all built-in page types (`HomePage`, `ContentPage`, `IndexPage`, `FormPage`) live in `wtrx/` — use them as-is. To add site-specific page types, create a new app and subclass `BasePage` and `HeroMixin` from `wtrx/`.
- **StreamField blocks**: use `BodyStreamBlock` as-is, or subclass it to add site-specific blocks (see [Customizing blocks](#customizing-blocks))
- **Settings models**: create new `BaseSiteSetting` subclasses (from `wagtail.contrib.settings`) in your own app if you need additional settings panels beyond what `wtrx/` already provides.

### Customizing blocks

If your fork needs a modified version of an existing block (e.g. adding a field to
`CardBlock`), subclass it at the site level rather than editing `wtrx/` directly.
Wagtail's `DeclarativeSubBlocksMetaclass` merges parent and child block definitions
via the MRO, so a subclass only needs to redeclare the blocks it wants to change.

**Example: adding a subtitle to CardBlock**

Create a site-level blocks module (e.g. `wagtail_wtr/mysite/blocks.py`):

```python
from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _
from wagtail.blocks import CharBlock, ListBlock

from wtrx.blocks import (
    BodyStreamBlock,
    CardBlock,
    CardGridBlock,
    SectionBlock,
    SectionContentBlock,
)


class SiteCardBlock(CardBlock):
    """CardBlock with an additional subtitle field."""
    subtitle = CharBlock(required=False, label=_("Subtitle"))


class SiteCardGridBlock(CardGridBlock):
    """CardGridBlock that uses SiteCardBlock."""
    cards = ListBlock(SiteCardBlock(), min_num=2, max_num=12, label=_("Cards"))


class SiteSectionContentBlock(SectionContentBlock):
    """Override card inside sections."""
    card = SiteCardBlock()
    card_grid = SiteCardGridBlock()


class SiteSectionBlock(SectionBlock):
    content = SiteSectionContentBlock()


class SiteBodyStreamBlock(BodyStreamBlock):
    """Site-level override that swaps in custom blocks."""
    card = SiteCardBlock()
    card_grid = SiteCardGridBlock()
    section = SiteSectionBlock()
```

Then update page models to use `SiteBodyStreamBlock` (in a new site-specific app):

```python
# mysite/models.py
from mysite.blocks import SiteBodyStreamBlock

class HomePage(BasePage, HeroMixin):
    body = StreamField(SiteBodyStreamBlock(), ...)
```

**Key points:**

- `wtrx/` stays untouched — upstream merges are clean.
- `SiteCardBlock` inherits all upstream fields, validation, and template from
  `CardBlock`. If upstream adds a field, your subclass gets it automatically.
- `SectionContentBlock` exists specifically to support this pattern — it's a named
  `StreamBlock` subclass so you can override individual child blocks without
  duplicating the full 17-entry block list.
- The only merge friction is the import-line changes in `mysite/models.py` — trivial one-line conflicts.
- **Template overrides**: block templates live in `templates/components/streamfield/blocks/`.
  You can modify them directly on your fork. When `wtrx` is extracted to a pip
  package, Django's template resolution will prefer your project-level templates
  over the package defaults.

`wtrx/` is the stable core. All page models and the search view live there. To add
site-specific page types, create a new app and subclass `BasePage`; don't edit `wtrx/` directly.

---

## Customizing the theme

Edit the `@theme {}` block in `static_src/css/theme.css` to change the semantic design tokens:

```css
@theme {
  /* Replace these color scales with your brand palette */
  --color-primary-50:  #f0f9ff;
  --color-primary-500: #0ea5e9;
  --color-primary-600: #0284c7;
  /* ... full scale 50–950 ... */

  /* Font stacks */
  --font-heading: 'Your Heading Font', system-ui, sans-serif;
  --font-body:    'Your Body Font', system-ui, sans-serif;
}
```

All templates use only semantic tokens (`bg-primary-600`, `font-heading`, etc.), so
changing the `@theme {}` values immediately re-themes the entire site. Rebuild after changes:

```bash
make build-prod
```

`theme.css` also ships named theme presets (`[data-theme="grassroots"]`, etc.) as
CSS overrides — no rebuild needed when switching between presets at runtime. Client
forks that don't use these can delete those blocks.

---

## Adding languages

In `wagtail_wtr/settings/base.py`, uncomment or add languages:

```python
WAGTAIL_CONTENT_LANGUAGES = LANGUAGES = [
    ("en", "English"),
    ("es", "Spanish"),
]
```

Translations are managed via the Wagtail admin using wagtail-localize.

---

## Platform integrations

Set defaults in `settings/base.py`:

```python
WTRX_DONATION_PLATFORM = "none"          # none | actblue
WTRX_SIGNUP_PLATFORM = "wagtail_forms"   # wagtail_forms | action_network | none
```

Override per-site in the Wagtail admin under **Settings > Integrations**.

---

## Development

```bash
# Watch mode: rebuilds CSS on file changes
make watch

# Run tests
python manage.py test wtrx wagtail_wtr

# Run a specific test module
python manage.py test wtrx.tests.test_images

# Generate migrations after model changes
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Create `wagtail_wtr/settings/local.py` for personal overrides (gitignored):

```python
from .dev import *

DATABASES = { ... }   # override as needed
DEBUG = True
```

---

## Deployment

Ships with:

- `Dockerfile` (Python 3.13-slim)
- `whitenoise` for static file serving
- `gunicorn` as WSGI server
- `dj-database-url` for `DATABASE_URL` env var
- `django-storages[s3]` + `wagtail-storages` for S3 media

Required environment variables in production:

```
SECRET_KEY=...
DATABASE_URL=postgres://...
ALLOWED_HOSTS=mysite.com,www.mysite.com
WAGTAILADMIN_BASE_URL=https://mysite.com
```

### Cloudflare cache invalidation (optional)

When Cloudflare is in front of your site, set these two environment variables and
the platform will automatically purge cached pages on publish and flush the entire
cache whenever site settings (branding, navigation, footer, social, integrations)
are saved.

```
CLOUDFLARE_BEARER_TOKEN=your-api-token
CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID=your-zone-id
```

**To get these values:**

1. **Zone ID** — in the Cloudflare dashboard, select your domain. The Zone ID
   appears in the right-hand panel under *API* on the Overview page.

2. **Bearer token** — go to **My Profile → API Tokens → Create Token**. Use the
   **Edit zone resources** template (or create a custom token) with these
   permissions:
   - Zone → Cache Purge → Purge
   - Zone Resources → Include → your specific zone (or all zones)
